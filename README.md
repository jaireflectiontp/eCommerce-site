# Idea

Being a frontend developer, I chose to develop a project using React.js, leveraging its features and capabilities, I wanted to use what I've learned to build an e-commerce project. I applied the principles I've studied to create a website that reflects what I've been taught.

# Tech Stack

In this project, I've utilized a robust tech stack comprising **React.js**, **Redux/Toolkit**, **SASS**, **Material UI**, **React-Bootstrap**, **Formik**, **React Router**, and **Axios**. These tools collectively empowered me to build a feature-rich e-commerce platform that integrates various functionalities while leveraging the strengths of each technology.

For the backend, I set up a server that serves mock data specifically tailored for this project.
This simplified backend structure allowed for seamless testing and development of the front-end functionalities without relying on a full-fledged backend system.

# Features

This project boasts a range of key features:

- **User Authentication:**

  - Implemented using Formik and Redux Toolkit.

- **Product Management:**

  - Utilized Redux Toolkit for efficient product management.

- **Cart and Checkout Functionality:**

  - Seamless integration for an easy shopping experience.

- **Product Filtering and Sorting:**

  - Implemented mechanisms for users to filter and sort products efficiently.

- **Dynamic Product Search:**
  - Enabled a search feature for users to find products easily.

## Products Page:

All the products displayed here are sourced from a server I personally created. I developed an **API** that contains comprehensive product details, distinct categories, associated filters, and image links. The entire webpage is constructed from various components, each serving distinct functionalities. Moreover, I've integrated utility functions for efficient filtering and sorting processes.
