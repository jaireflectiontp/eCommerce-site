Being a frontend developer, I chose to develop a project using React.js, leveraging its features and capabilities, I wanted to use what I've learned to build an e-commerce project. I applied the principles I've studied to create a website that reflects what I've been taught.

In this project, I've utilized a robust tech stack comprising React.js, Redux/Toolkit, SASS, Material UI, React-Bootstrap, Formik, React Router, and Axios. These tools collectively empowered me to build a feature-rich e-commerce platform that integrates various functionalities while leveraging the strengths of each technology.

For the backend, I set up a server that serves mock data specifically tailored for this project. 
This simplified backend structure allowed for seamless testing and development of the front-end functionalities without relying on a full-fledged backend system.



This project boasts a range of key features:
- **User Authentication:**
  - Implemented using Formik and Redux Toolkit.

- **Product Management:**
  - Utilized Redux Toolkit for efficient product management.

- **Cart and Checkout Functionality:**
  - Seamless integration for an easy shopping experience.

- **Product Filtering and Sorting:**
  - Implemented mechanisms for users to filter and sort products efficiently.

- **Dynamic Product Search:**
  - Enabled a search feature for users to find products easily.
